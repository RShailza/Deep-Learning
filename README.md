Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model
For this part of the Challenge, youâ€™ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for AlphabetSoup.
The report should contain the following:


Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
## Overview
purpose of the analysis is predicting success of the applicants funded by non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup. 

## Results

What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- target of my model is variable "IS_SUCCESSFUL"
- 
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?


Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?





Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
